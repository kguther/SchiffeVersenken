How to Build the Documentation
==============================

The Documentation for this project is powered by sphinx, a tool that extracts the docstrings from 
the python modules and presents them nicely.

In order to build the documentation you obviously have to have the sphinx package (>=1.3) installed on your
system. Because the version provided by some distributions (for example Open Suse 13.1) can be quite old, it
is recomended to use the python package manager pip to install sphinx. 

To install sphinx and the html theme used for this documentation run the commands

pip install Sphinx
pip install sphinx-rtd-theme

If you don't have root privilages on your machine, you can provide pip with the option --user in order to install
the package in your own home directory.



If everything is up and runing you can run the command

make html

inside this directory to build the documentation.
The result can be found in the _build/html directory (open index.html).


Other Output Formats
====================

Sphinx can not only create html output, but also build the documentation in various other fromats like pdf (using LaTeX),
epub, manpage, etc

To list all available formats run 

make help
